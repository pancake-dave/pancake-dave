# Hi there 👋 I’m Dawid!

🎓 **Computer Science student** with a passion for building things — both in code and in real life.  
💻 I enjoy exploring how web technologies work under the hood and tinkering with ideas that mix software and hardware.  
🤝 I’d love to collaborate on beginner-friendly or creative projects! Want to build a not-very-smart-but-cute robot vacuum together?
